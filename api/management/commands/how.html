        We want people who live, work or play on the island to weigh in on critical questions about race, immigration, gentrification and inclusion. We want to hear your crazy imaginings of how we can make this a more a dynamic inclusive community that keeps it real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently we are accepting submissions via email at <a href="mailto:GetOutIsland@gmail.com">GetOutIsland@gmail.com</a>. An upload function will be coming soon. You can also reach out to us via email if you would prefer to set up an interview with a volunteer on our team.
      </p>

        Keep it simple. You can film a dance on your smartphone, send us a poem, painting or essay. Be creative. We will accept all submissions that meet the <a href="/groundrules">Ground Rules</a>. All ages are welcome (consent forms must be signed by parents for minors under 18 years of age).

        We cannot begin to hope without addressing our feelings of injustice and social alienation. In this way, hope and injustice are two sides of the same coin - you canâ€™t have one without the other. The Word To RI collective seeks to catalyze discussions that relate to these themes on Roosevelt Island.
